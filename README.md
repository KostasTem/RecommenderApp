# RecommenderApp

This app was created as my bachelor's thesis. It is an android application that can be used to send a user recommendations for apps to install based on what users who like similar apps to them have installed on their phones.

# Setup

For the app to create a secure connection to the API it needs the servers public certificate to be placed in the `raw` folder inside the applications `res` folder. Then the certificate name along with the API's ip address or domain name should be placed in the corresponding positions in the network_security_config.xml file
